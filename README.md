**TIPSY** is a tip calculator application for iOS.

Submitted by: **Adit Mohindra**

Time spent: **5** hours spent in total

## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is complete:

* [x] User can enter a bill amount, choose a tip percentage, and see the tip and total values.
* [x] User can select between tip percentages by tapping different values on the segmented control and the tip value is updated accordingly

The following **optional** features are implemented:

* [ ] UI animations
* [ ] Remembering the bill amount across app restarts (if <10mins)
* [ ] Using locale-specific currency and currency thousands separators.
* [ ] Making sure the keyboard is always visible and the bill amount is always the first responder. This way the user doesn't have to tap anywhere to use this app. Just launch the app and start typing.

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [ ] List anything else that you can get done to improve the app functionality!

## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.

I did not know Swift at all so first I spent time watching free Stanford University Lectures on SwiftUI. However, the app was developed using Storyboard, so I then had to learn that which took more time. I was trying for a while and communicating with CodePath TA's in order to get my Settings portion in the optional features to work, however even after their help my settings portion of the application did not work. I hope to further update this app with more additional features and improve the UI as time goes on and I have more free time outside of my current coursework.
